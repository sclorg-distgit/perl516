Package %{scl_name} provides Perl programming language delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working Perl
programming language.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'perl'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming. A large
proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'perl program.pl'
  Execute program.pl by Perl from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man perl'
  Show man pages for the perl command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
